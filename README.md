# twirk-demo
A demo of Twirk, and how I use it

This project is really there mostly to demonstrate the basics of how I use my own bot library. I do cut some corners here though, since this project does not have access to a database for persistance in between sessions, but it should communicate the basics at least.

Do note that you're gonna have to set some properties in the SystemConfig.java file before running the program. To stop the program, type `.quit` in the console.

Also, to run the program, if you cannot run it from an IDE, run `mvn exec:java`
